## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Web Server:** Apache or Nginx (often bundled with XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP)
* **PHP:** Version 7.4 or higher (or the specific version you used)
* **MySQL:** Database server
* **Git:** For cloning the repository

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/agence-immobilier.git](https://github.com/your-username/agence-immobilier.git)
    cd agence-immobilier
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/agence-immobilier` with your actual GitHub repository path)*

2.  **Set up Database:**
    * Create a new MySQL database (e.g., `bzbzd`).
    * Import your database schema and initial data. If you have an `.sql` file, you can import it using phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command line:
        ```bash
        mysql -u your_username -p bzbzd < path/to/your/database_dump.sql
        ```
        *(Replace `your_username`, `bzbzd`, and `path/to/your/database_dump.sql` with your credentials and file path)*

3.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    * Locate your database connection file (likely `db_connection.php` or a similar file in `includes/`).
    * Update the database credentials (hostname, username, password, database name) to match your MySQL setup.
    * *(If you use environment variables, create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in the details.)*

4.  **Place Project on Web Server:**
    * Move the cloned `agence-immobilier` folder into your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache/XAMPP, `www` for WAMP, `public_html` for MAMP).

5.  **Start Web Server:**
    * Ensure your Apache/Nginx and MySQL services are running.
